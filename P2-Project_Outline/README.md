## Submission Instructions

### Overview
The application will enable a Dungeons and Dragons player to input character information, and answer various questions about that character such as “What spells can I learn next level?”, “How do I deal max DPS against an Ancient Black Dragon?” and more. This will keep players from having to wade through all of the various rulebooks attached to D&D while making roleplaying decisions about their characters. I always find I would like more resources while deciding what to do while playing Dungeons and Dragons, so I am making an app I would like to use, and I hope others would find it useful as well.  
### Features
User Login: Users will be able to create accounts where they will find data associated with just that account.
Character Creation: Users will be able to input character information and save those characters for later use, so they don't have to input information every time they want to use the application.
Search: Users will be able to search for enemies they want to fight, spells they want to learn, or information about other D&D features.
"How should I?": Users will be able to correlate their character information and search results to answer questions like: "Do I have spells that are strong against Slimes?" or "How many spells can I learn when I level up?"
